# Container-Native Architecture

Talk given on October 29th, 2015 at [ContainerDays NYC 2015](http://dynamicinfradays.org/events/2015-nyc/programme.html#architecture).

### Abstract

Moving your application into a container and deploying it to production is a great first step towards taking advantage of containerization. This gets you past "works on my machine", and Docker makes this easy. But the real value of containers -- fast immutable deployments, maximizing resource utilization, and bare-metal performance -- comes from an architecture optimized for containers. This is container-native architecture.

Tim will explore the story of a real-world large scale production microservices deployment of Docker, and the challenges faced in both design and operations of migrating this kind of multi-faceted application to a container-native architecture.
